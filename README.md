# Christian Sakai's Resume

My resume written in LaTeX. Template is based on [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)

To compile:
1. Install full version of [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
2. Run `$ xelatex resume.tex`

If you are using [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) to edit this with Vim. Be advised that vimtex is using `latexmk` to compile. To make `latexmk` uses `xelatex`, see the file `.latexmkrc` in this repository.
